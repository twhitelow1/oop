Line 5 creates a new list object using the imported list class from list.rb
when this new instance of the list class is created it creates a single instace variable
called task. The data type of that instance varaible is an array which contains a list of task.
The whole class interacts with this array of task

Line 8 uses the add_task method on the created list object and adds a task object to the list array that
list object represents.

Line 14 uses puts to display what is returned by "list.tasks[1].name". list.tasks[1].name uses dot notation
to access the tasks array that is returned by list.tasks. Then using bracket notation "tasks[1]" the program selects the
second task object in the tasks array retruned by list.tasks. Now that the program has the selected task object instance
the program uses dot notation to access the name of the task with "task[1].name"
 that contains each tasks instance that reprmethod of the tasks object
